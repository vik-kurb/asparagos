# The Smartest Peanut in the Neighborhood ðŸ¥œ

Remember how the walnuts once tried to find out who was the [smartest](../walnut_iq/README.md)? Now it's the peanuts' turn, though their approach is a bit different.

Peanuts don't care about being the smartest among all nuts. They just want to feel smarter than their nearby neighbors.

Youâ€™re given the cleverness levels of peanuts planted in a row. For each group of `k` consecutive peanuts, determine which peanut is the smartest.

Is it a hard nut to crack?

### Input ðŸŒ°
- A slice of integers â€” each integer represents the cleverness level of a peanut in the row.
- `k` â€” an integer that represents the size of a group (a sliding window).

### Output ðŸŒ±
- A slice of integers â€” each representing the maximum cleverness level within a sliding window of size `k`.

### Examples ðŸ¥’:

- **Example 1**

    Input: `[1, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 6], k = 3`

    Output: `[6, 6, 4, 4, 6]`

    The first group is `[1, 6, 3]`, its maximum is `6`.
    The second group is `[6, 3, 4]`, its maximum is `6`.
    The third group is `[3, 4, 1]`, its maximum is `4`.
    The fourth group is `[4, 1, 2]`, its maximum is `4`.
    The last group is `[1, 2, 6]`, its maximum is `6`.

- **Example 2**

    Input: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1], k = 2`

    Output: `[2, 3, 3, 2]`

    The first group is `[1, 2]`, its maximum is `2`.
    The second group is `[2, 3]`, its maximum is `3`.
    The third group is `[3, 2]`, its maximum is `3`.
    The last group is `[2, 1]`, its maximum is `2`.
