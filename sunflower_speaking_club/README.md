# Sunflower Speaking Club ðŸŒ»

Sunflowers are planning to expand their influence across the world. Olives are gaining popularity, they canâ€™t fall behind. To achieve this, they need to learn English.

Each sunflower already speaks it to some extent, but wants to find a partner to practice with. The sunflowers are planted in a row. Each has their own level of English and wants to find the nearest sunflower to the right who speaks better than they do.

Why to the right? The sun is rising in the east, so itâ€™s the perfect moment to combine business with pleasure.
